# CRUD App with React and RTK Query

In this document, I will explain how to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using React and RTK Query.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: This is required to run the server and manage packages.
- **npm**: This comes with Node.js and is used to install packages.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pxycknomdictator/rtk-query-practice.git
   cd rtk-query-practice
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following command to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Server**
   To start the backend server, execute:

   ```
   npm run serve
   ```

4. **Run the React App**
   To start the backend server, execute:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Application Overview

**Features**

- Create: Add new entries to the application.
- Read: Fetch and display existing entries.
- Update: Modify existing entries.
- Delete: Remove entries from the application.

## Using RTK Query

RTK Query is used to simplify data fetching and state management. It helps in handling API calls efficiently, making it easier to manage server state in our React application.
